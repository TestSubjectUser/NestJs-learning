nest g module lesson

defining the lesson GraphQL type
ObjectType with types named lesson, four fields, ID field is type of ID

creating the lesson resolver
Resolvers are the core of how GraphQL works in NestJS. They handle queries, mutations, and subscriptions by fetching data from a database or another source.

@Resolver(() => LessonType): Specifies that this resolver handles LessonType queries.
Without resolvers, GraphQL would not know how to respond to API requests.

Every resolver is just a service that provides data. In NestJS, we must register services in the providers array so that NestJS can inject and manage them.

we can visit http://localhost:3000/graphql if server is running, check out schema

create lesson graphql mutation

add mutation with graphql

```mutation{
  createLesson(
    name: "Khushal name 1"
    startDate: "2020-03-28T18:00:00Z"
    endDate: "2020-03-28T18:00:00Z"
  ){
    name
  }
}
```

now we can see it in our localhost robo3t that mutation has happened

npm install class-validator class-transformer

Decorator that marks a class as a GraphQL input type.
@Field() decorator is used to mark a specific class property as a GraphQL field. Only properties decorated with this decorator will be defined in the schema.

```graphql
mutation {
  createLesson(
    createLessonInput: {
      name: "someName"
      startDate: "2025-02-28T18:00:00Z"
      endDate: "2025-02-28T18:00:00Z"
    }
  ) {
    name
  }
}
# query{
# 	lesson(id: "ac40204e-449d-4293-b906-a83ba0862268"){
#     id
